ui for logging in 
should we make it:
    service which comms with login service and allows logging in aswell as publishing login info on load through mb
    seperate ui which comms with said service to login user or logout through mb
    other services can then get login state via said service through mb
      or
    ui service which comms with login service and allows loggin in and logging out aswell as publishing login info on load through mb
    other services can get login state via said service through mb but cant login via mb
